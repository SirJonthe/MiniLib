On daya layout
* If MGL is general purpose, with the possibility of using as a foundation for a hardware accelerated engine, then swizzling textures as cache optimization for the CPU doesn't make sense.
* Maybe use an indexing function that orders and fetches data in different ways?

* Noise functions:
 - Perlin noise
 - Ridged Perlin noise
 - Mid-point displacement
 - Diamond-Square
 - Voronoi
